安装好python运行环境最好是python3以上, 示例使用的是Python 3.9.6

需要安装的第三方库
  PIL库    pip install pillow

或许下面的库已经在你的python版本中集成了, 不需要安装
  threading库     pip install threading
  ctypes库    pip install ctypes
  time库      pip install time
  abc库       pip install abc


It is recommended to use a Python 3.x environment, with Python 3.9.6 being the version used in the example.

Third-party libraries to be installed:
  PIL library: pip install pillow

Alternatively, the following libraries may already be included in your Python version and do not need to be installed:
  threading library: pip install threading
  ctypes library: pip install ctypes
  time library: pip install time
  abc library: pip install abc
